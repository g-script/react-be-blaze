## `TL;DR;`

react-be-blaze is a tiny React wrapper for [BlazeCSS][blaze] components.

Check out the [demo][demo]! :warning: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :warning:

## Intro

[BlazeCSS][blaze] is, as written on their website at the time of writing, an ‚Äú open source modular CSS toolkit providing great structure for building websites quickly ‚Äù.

In my opinion, this toolkit ‚Äî _or framework, take your pick_ ‚Äî has a great advantage compared to well-known CSS frameworks like [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] or [Zurb Foundation][foundation]: it won‚Äôt handle things for you.

**You** are the master of your project and **you** have to make the right choices to fit your needs.

Of course, it‚Äôs not a plug-and-play framework, so you‚Äôll actually have to write some code... **That‚Äôs the power of BlazeCSS!**

## Why

Each and every experienced web designer/developer know the big problem of CSS: **scope**.

Because CSS is globally scoped, it is often difficult to apply a class of `.active` for example. Let‚Äôs try to demonstrate this point, consider the following code:

```css
.button {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.nav-item {
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

Now, you need to have an `.active` state for your `.button`. Sounds pretty easy:

```css
.active {
  border-color: blue;
}
```

Nice! Your `.button` can now have a class of `.active` which changes its `border-color` to `blue`.

But now, you also need an `.active` class for your `.nav-item`! You can‚Äôt just use the class we created above, because you don‚Äôt want to change the `border-color` on `.active`, you want to change the `background` to `red`.

Let‚Äôs try this!

```css
.active {
  background: red;
}
```

**Problem is**, now you have **two** `.active` classes‚Ä¶ Which one will be applied, then?

Well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all about [CSS Specificity][css specificity]!

Let‚Äôs take a look at our complete CSS:

```css
.button {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.nav-item {
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.active {
  border-color: blue;
}

.active {
  background: red;
}
```

And consider the following HTML:

```html
<ul class="nav">
  <li class="nav-item">Normal item</li>
  <li class="nav-item active">Active item</li>
</ul>
<main>
  <button class="button active">Just an active button</button>
</main>
```

The `.active` `.nav-item` will have a `blue` `border-color` and a `red` `background` ‚Äî _pretty ugly, right?_.

Furthermore, the `.active` `.button` will have a `blue` `border-color` and a `red` `background` too!

That‚Äôs the **BIG** problem about CSS, we can even conclude that with our dummy example... and every web developer will have to pull his air out on it one day or another.

## What

We now are aware of this problem, and guess what? It already has been solved! Well, **in fact**, it has only been _virtually_ solved.

A bunch of high skilled developer has been working on this and created patterns and standards. You might know some, but here we are only going to speak about <abbr title="Objet-Oriented CSS">OOCSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Block-Element-Modifier">BEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Inverted Triangle CSS">ITCSS</abbr>.

### OOCSS

This approach is the most known of three, [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [Zurb Foundation][foundation] entirely rely on it.

Its all about leveraging [CSS Specificity][css specificity] by applying multiple classes to elements in order to tweak their appearance or behavior. If you need an example, just take a look at [Bootstrap][bootstrap docs] or [Foundation][foundation docs] docs, you‚Äòll get my point.

### BEM

The BEM pattern is also used in a less knowned CSS framework - _but still, it‚Äòs made by Google_ - : [material-design-lite][mdl].

BEM principle is pretty simple: all CSS classes follow a nested HTML structure, composed as elements in blocks with the ability to have modifiers expressing their state. Just read [BlazeCSS docs][blaze docs] to see how it looks!

### ITCSS

ITCSS is different from OOCSS and BEM because it‚Äòs more about grouping styles in strictly-ruled categories. If you want to understand how it works, I recommend you to take 5 minutes - _really, it worth it_ - and read [these slides about ITCSS by Harry Roberts][itcss]!

## How

OK, here we are... We exposed the problem, we saw there were solutions: let‚Äòs talk about react-be-blaze!

First of all, BlazeCSS is following BEM and ITCSS naming conventions, so it‚Äòs robust and easily scalable :wink: !

### So what?

Actually, react-be-blaze is no more than a library providing you ready-to-use components using BlazeCSS styles!

### Why would I choose it?

It‚Äòs **small**, not such as BlazeCSS - _which isn‚Äòt included_ -, but still :

```shell
                Asset     Size
react-be-blaze.min.js     83 kB
```

It‚Äòs **easy to install**:

```shell
$ npm install --save react-be-blaze
```

It‚Äòs **easy to use**:

```javascript
// ESModules ‚Äî so cool!
import { Button } from "react-be-blaze";

// ES2015 ‚Äî meh.
const { Button } = require("react-be-blaze");

// ES5 ‚Äî really?
var reactBeBlaze = require("react-be-blaze");
var Button = reactBeBlaze.Button;
```

It has a **great [demo][demo]**! :warning: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :warning:
